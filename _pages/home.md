I am a Computer Science PhD Researcher under [Dr. Frank Ferarro](https://www.csee.umbc.edu/people/faculty/frank-ferraro/) at the [University of Maryland, Baltimore County](https://umbc.edu/) (UMBC). My research combines **Natural Language Processing** (NLP) and **Computer Vision** (CV).

My primary research focuses on multimodal <span class="tooltip-text" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="Event Modeling is a method of describing systems using an example of how information has changed within them over time.">event</span> reasoning, understanding, and generation. My previous work, a hierarchical variational autoencoder for event representation learning, has applications in text summarization, question answering, and <span class="tooltip-text" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" title="What would happen if some facts are changed?">counterfactual</span> reasoning (Published in **[*SEM 2023, ACL](https://aclanthology.org/2023.starsem-1.31?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page)**).

<!-- I completed my M.Sc. in CS with [Phi Kappa Phi](https://phikappaphi.meritpages.com/stories/Shubhashis-Roy-Dipta-Inducted-into-The-Honor-Society-of-Phi-Kappa-Phi/107714395) (**[CGPA 4.0/4.0](/assets/pdf/masters_transcript.pdf?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page)**)  in Spring 2023 at UMBC. Before my M.Sc., I gained over 3 years of industry experience as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. During that time, I also worked with [Dr. Iman Dehzangi](https://cs.camden.rutgers.edu/faculty-staff/iman-dehzangi-ph-d/) (Rutgers University) and published [4 journal papers](/publications?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page). -->

I have a strong background in ML programming, including PyTorch, ðŸ¤— HuggingFace, NLTK, Spacy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more. I've excelled in machine learning competitions (**[Kaggle top-70 ðŸ¥‰](/projects/kaggle_bird?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page)**) and coding competitions (**[ACM ICPC 8th out of 300+ teams](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/dhaka-2019/standings)**) and [more](/awards?utm_source=roydipta.com&utm_medium=about-page). I was the founder of **[UniShopr](https://unishopr.com)**, a cross-border e-commerce for my home country (Bangladesh).
