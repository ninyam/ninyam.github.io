> “Teachers have three loves: love of learning, love of learners, and the love of bringing the first two loves together.”
> –Hayden Scott

I am passionate about making mathematics more welcoming, more accessible, and less intimidating. I also belief mathematical endeavors are human endeavors, and they should be pursued in accordance with the axioms of [Professor Federico Ardila-Mantilla](https://fardila.com):

**Axiom 1.** Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.

**Axiom 2.** Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.

**Axiom 3.** Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.

**Axiom 4.** Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
