> “Teachers have three loves: love of learning, love of learners, and the love of bringing the first two loves together.”
> –Hayden Scott

I am passionate about making mathematics more welcoming, more accessible, and less intimidating. I also belief mathematical endeavors are human endeavors, and they should be pursued in accordance with the axioms of Professor Federico Ardila-Mantilla<d-footnote>[Todos cuentan: Cultivating diversity in combinatorics](https://www.ams.org/publications/journals/notices/201610/rnoti-p1164.pdf). Notices of the American Mathematical Society 63:1164–1170, 2016.</d-footnote>:

*Axiom 1.* Mathematical potential is equally present in different groups, irrespective of geographic, demographic, and economic boundaries.
*Axiom 2.* Everyone can have joyful, meaningful, and empowering mathematical experiences.
*Axiom 3.* Mathematics is a powerful, malleable tool that can be shaped and used differently by various communities to serve their needs.
*Axiom 4.* Every student deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.
