My research interests lie at the interface of algebra, algebraic geometry, and, algebraic topology. Also, I have been expanding my research interests to the area of topological data analysis and its application to solve problems in mathematical biology.

In my doctoral thesis, I established decomposition theorems for topological Azumaya algebras, and topological Azumaya algebras with involutions of the first kind.

I am currently working on the computation of the integral cohomology of classifying spaces of some projective spaces. I am also working on a TDA+MathBio project with Veronica Ciocanel.

### Publications 
Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page. It’s easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format. Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.
