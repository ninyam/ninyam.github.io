My research spans `Algebraic Topology`, `Topological Data Analysis` and its application to other disciplines, and, more recently, the  `Scholarship of Teaching and Learning`. 

In my doctoral thesis, I established decomposition theorems for topological Azumaya algebras, and for topological Azumaya algebras with involutions of the first kind.
