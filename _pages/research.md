My research spans `Algebraic Topology`, and applications of `Topological Data Analysis` to other disciplines. 

In my doctoral thesis, I established decomposition theorems for topological Azumaya algebras, and for topological Azumaya algebras with involutions of the first kind. 

During my postdoc, I was a member of the [Ciocanel Group](https://sites.math.duke.edu/~ciocanel/group.html), where I focused on understanding aster and ring structures in cellular actin filaments using TDA.
