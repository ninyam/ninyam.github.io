In January 2025, I joined the [Department of Mathematics](https://math.sfsu.edu) at San Francisco State University as an Assistant Professor. I am a member of the [Black and Latinx/e Student Success Cohort](https://cose.sfsu.edu/news/new-faculty-bring-diverse-expertise-college-science-engineering).

I was a William W. Elliot Assistant Research Professor at the Department of Mathematics at Duke University. My postdoctoral mentors were [Kirsten Wickelgren](https://services.math.duke.edu/~kgw/index.html) and [Veronica Ciocanel](https://services.math.duke.edu/~ciocanel/).

I obtained my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the University of British Columbia in August 2021. I worked under the supervision of [Ben Williams](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/) and [Alejandro Adem](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~adem/). Before that, I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Medellín under the supervision of [José Manuel Gómez Guerra](https://sites.google.com/a/unal.edu.co/jmgomez0/english). I got my B.Sc. in Mathematics at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Manizales. More details on my academic background and activities are available on my **[cv](/assets/pdf/cv_NinyAM_092824.pdf)**.
