I am a William W. Elliot Assistant Research Professor at the Department of Mathematics at Duke University since January 2022. My postdoctoral mentors are [Kirsten Wickelgren](https://services.math.duke.edu/~kgw/index.html) and [Veronica Ciocanel](https://services.math.duke.edu/~ciocanel/).

I obtained my Ph.D. in the Department of Mathematics at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in August 2021. I worked under the supervision of [Ben Williams](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~tbjw/) and [Alejandro Adem](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~adem/). Before that, I completed my M.Sc. in Mathematics at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Medellín under the supervision of [José Manuel Gómez Guerra](https://sites.google.com/a/unal.edu.co/jmgomez0/english). I got my B.Sc. in Mathematics at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia in Manizales. More details on my academic background and activities are available on my cv.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
