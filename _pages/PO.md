> “The real satisfaction from mathematics is in learning from others and sharing with others.”
> –[Bill Thurston](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/43690/whats-a-mathematician-to-do)

Together with [Maye Montoya](https://www.mathematics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/postdoctoral-fellows/mayecxiliana-cardenas-montoya) and [Carlos Ospina](https://www.math.utah.edu/~ospina/), I co-organize [Pares Ordenados](https://ninyam.github.io/paresordenados/index), a free online mathematics mentorship program in Spanish. The program connects math students with graduate students or early-career mathematicians around the world, who serve as mentors for semester-long reading projects. 

#### WHO?
Pares Ordenados especially aims to provide such mentorship to Spanish-speaking students in Latin America from underrepresented groups in mathematics, as well as to students at non-research oriented universities.

<!-- - Women
- Students of African descent
- Students of indigenous descent
- Students who survived armed conflicts and/or forced displacement
- Students who are members of the LGBTQIA+ community
- Students who are immigrants or refugees
- Students with visible and/or invisible disabilities
- Students from Central America -->

#### HOW?
Pares Ordenados takes place online.

- Undergraduate students apply to be mentees.
- Graduate students or early career mathematicians apply to be mentors.
- Mentees and mentors are paired based on mutual interests. Each pair decides on a topic for the semester.
- Each ordered pair `(mentor, mentee)` meets online for one hour weekly.
- Halfway through the semester, each pair decides on a final project and writes a project description that must be sent to the organizers.
- At the end of the semester, there is an online event where mentees give short presentations about their directed reading course, and attend the panel about _Latinx/Hispanic Mathematicians Around The World_.

#### WHAT FOR?
> “What is belonging? The extent to which an individual feels accepted, valued, and legitimate within the community.”
> –[Deanna Haunsperger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwAE3iHi4vM)

Pares Ordenados is about the community! Apart from providing students a way to learn mathematics that otherwise they would not have access to, we also aim to foster connections among the members of our Latinx/Hispanic Math Community around the world.
