> “The real satisfaction from mathematics is in learning from others and sharing with others.”
> –[Bill Thurston](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/43690/whats-a-mathematician-to-do)

Together with [Maye Montoya](https://www.mathematics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/postdoctoral-fellows/mayecxiliana-cardenas-montoya) and [Carlos Ospina](https://www.math.utah.edu/~ospina/), I co-organize [Pares Ordenados](https://ninyam.github.io/paresordenados/index), a free online mathematics mentorship program in Spanish. The program connects math students with graduate students or early-career mathematicians around the world, who serve as mentors for semester-long reading projects. 

#### WHO?
Pares Ordenados especially aims to provide such mentorship to Spanish-speaking students in Latin America from underrepresented groups in mathematics, as well as to students at non-research oriented universities.

<!-- - Women
- Students of African descent
- Students of indigenous descent
- Students who were victims of armed conflicts and/or forced displacement
- Students who are members of the LGBTQIA+ community
- Students who are immigrants or refugees
- Students with visible and/or invisible disabilities
- Students from Central America -->

#### HOW?
Pares Ordenados takes place online.

- Undergraduate students apply to be mentees.
- Graduate students or early career mathematicians apply to be mentors.
- Mentees and mentors are paired based on mutual interests. Each pair decides on a topic for the semester.
- Each ordered pair `(mentor, mentee)` meets online for one hour weekly.
- Halfway through the semester, each pair decides on a final project and writes a project description that must be sent to the organizers.
- At the end of the semester, there is an online event where mentees give short presentations about their directed reading course, and attend the panel about _Latinx/Hispanic Mathematicians Around The World_.

#### WHAT FOR?
> “What is belonging? The extent to which an individual feels accepted, valued, and legitimate within the community.”
> –[Deanna Haunsperger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwAE3iHi4vM)

Pares Ordenados is about the community! Apart from providing students a way to learn mathematics that otherwise they would not have access to, we also aim to foster connections among the members of our Latinx/Hispanic Math Community around the world.

This theme supports rendering beautiful math in inline and display modes using [MathJax 3](https://www.mathjax.org/) engine. You just need to surround your math expression with `$$`, like `$$ E = mc^2 $$`. If you leave it inside a paragraph, it will produce an inline expression, just like $$ E = mc^2 $$.

To use display mode, again surround your expression with `$$` and place it as a separate paragraph. Here is an example:

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty |\langle x, e_k \rangle|^2 \leq \|x\|^2
$$

You can also use `\begin{equation}...\end{equation}` instead of `$$` for display mode math.
MathJax will automatically number equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cauchy-schwarz}
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
\end{equation}

and by adding `\label{...}` inside the equation environment, we can now refer to the equation using `\eqref`.

Note that MathJax 3 is [a major re-write of MathJax](https://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/upgrading/whats-new-3.0.html) that brought a significant improvement to the loading and rendering speed, which is now [on par with KaTeX](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).
